-> Process

1. Run Synthesis
2. Run Implementation
3. Bitstream
4. Open Target and connect board
5. Program on board


-> Debugging
- open messages in bottom panel for detailed error statements
- synthesis error -> Coding error
- simulation error -> testbench error (i think, maybe)
- port error (bitstream) => constraint file issue, check port naming 
	- map to correct port in FPGA (button is W19, U18, T17, T18, U17)
	- in correct section (idk why its so sensitive)
	- button in button section 
	
set_property PACKAGE_PIN W19 [get_ports fifty]
    set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports fifty]
    
set_property PACKAGE_PIN U18 [get_ports dollar]
    set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports dollar]
    
set_property PACKAGE_PIN T17 [get_ports cancel]
    set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports cancel]


-> Testbench
- test bench name must be same as verilog file
